## Assembler for Intel 8080 &amp; 8085 microprocessors
This is a two pass assembler, using the first pass to look up Opcodes, decode operands, and locate labels.  The second pass uses the labels to resolve address references.  The final step is .hex file creation.  This assembler does not support macros, relocatable code or GUI interface.
